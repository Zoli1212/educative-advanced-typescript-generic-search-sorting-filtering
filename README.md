# Advanced TypeScript: Generic Search, Sorting and Filtering

This is the code repository for my course "Advanced TypeScript: Generic Search, Sorting and Filtering", available on [Skillshare](https://www.skillshare.com/classes/Advanced-TypeScript-Generic-Search-Sorting-and-Filtering/1458010668/projects) and [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/course/draft/3822500/?referralCode=22441D8B6B06045473D2).

A preview of the course (6 of the 19 lessons) is also available on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLOX_mQri1cCleaUEI_k2qDaWFpnA7wW0z).

Note that each lesson branch corresponds to what was done in that lesson! ðŸ˜„

A final preview of the app we'll build throughout the course is [here on this repositories GitHub Pages site](https://princefishthrower.github.io/react-typescript-course-generic-search-sort-filter/).
